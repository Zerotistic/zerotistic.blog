# Who am I?
I am a 20 years old dude who loves reverse engineering, pwn and automation.
I currently live in France and study computer security at Ecole 2600.
I do CTFs weekly and have been part of the Belgium team at ECSC in 2022 and 2023. I main pwn and reverse engineering, but I also do some web and can grep forensics flags.

# What is this blog about?
This blog is about my adventures in the world of reverse engineering, pwn and automation.
I will try to post at least once a week, but I can't promise anything.

# Why did I create this blog?
I created this blog to share my knowledge with the world and to improve my writing skills.
I also created it because I **love** Binary Ninja and I want to share my knowledge about it with the world. I want everyone, whoever it is, to be able to use Binary Ninja to its full potential. 
I want them to tell others to drop IDA and Ghidra and to use Binary Ninja instead. This is just how much I love Binary Ninja. My love for pwn and automation are also a big reason to the creation of this blog, of course.
