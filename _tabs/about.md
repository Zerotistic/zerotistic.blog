# Who am I?
I am a 21 years old dude who loves reverse engineering, pwn and automation. I currently live in France and work as a vulnerability researcher and reverse engineer at [Hackcyom](https://www.hackcyom.com/).
I do CTFs weekly and have been part of the Belgium team at ECSC in 2022/2023/2024. I main pwn and reverse engineering, but I also do some web, can grep forensics flags and guess the crypto.
I am a CTF player for [idek](https://www.idek.team/) & [Friendly Maltese Citizens](https://ctf.mt/) (with who I played as a finalist for DEFCON 2024)

# What is this blog about?
This blog is about my adventures in the world of reverse engineering, pwn, automation and dumb ideas.
I will try to post at least once a month, but I can't promise anything.

# Why did I create this blog?
I created this blog to share my knowledge with the world and to improve my writing skills.
I also created it because I **love** Binary Ninja and I want to share my knowledge about it with the world. I want everyone, whoever it is, to be able to use Binary Ninja to its full potential.
