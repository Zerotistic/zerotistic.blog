# Binary Ninja Serie Announcement
I'm going to start a serie of posts about Binary Ninja. I'm going to start from the very beginning, so if you are already a Binary Ninja user, you can probably skip the first posts. I'm going to attempt to cover all topics, from how to use Binary Ninja to knowing the internals so well you could do PRs to Vector35's repositories.

At the time of writing, I believe I already known somewhat well Binary Ninja, however this blog post will also serve as a mean to learn new things and to improve my knowledge of the tool. This means that I might rewrite and update some parts as I learn new things. 

I'm going to try to keep the posts as simple as possible, but I'm not going to sacrifice the quality of the content for the sake of simplicity. This means that, while I cover Binary Ninja's usage, I will NOT be teaching you how to reverse or how to use Python, C, or any other language. I will assume you already know how to do that.

This post is hopefully the first of a long serie. I'm going to try to post at least once a week, but I can't promise anything. 

See you soon!
