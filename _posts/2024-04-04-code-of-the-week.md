Hello everybody! I have been busy with various things lately and didn't post anything new lately. However, as part of my daily job, I have started writing a blog post series on code review. It is meant to cover less known and logic bugs - because I believe that there are already thousands of blog posts on "normal" bugs likle XSS, SQLiâ€¦ and that it is thus less interesting.

Below you will find linked all the posts I've made so far, and will update regularly.
Please, enjoy the reading!
